          <p class="lead pt-3" >Informed decisions are at the core of any successful research project. Through review of literature we attempt to paint the most accurate picture of some necessary context in our heads - for example, the ideal assay for characterizing our system as a proof of concept in mammalian cells or a mouse model. However, often a personal interaction with an expert in this topic would be able to answer questions that papers cannot, and offer personalized insight into the approaches you are pitching. For this reason, we believed it was critical for us to integrate insight obtained from experts through interviews throughout the year to our design process.

            <h2><b>1. Understanding the Problem</b></h2>
            <p>To make sure our proposed design is most accurately solving the issue at hand, we must first understand the problem from different angles. The perspectives obtained from literature search cannot do justice to the knowledge that experts in the field hold regarding inconvenience of biopsies and exploration of alternatives. Having directly interacted with affected patients, they have seen first-hand accounts of the satisfaction of end users when being screened for immune activity. We have therefore interviewed certain experts to weigh in on what they believe is the issue.

            <p class="lead">He reminded us of how important our work is by recognizing that it has potential to help clinicians perform cancer diagnosis and treatment with enhanced efficiency. While he acknowledged that it is unlikely this project could replace biopsies entirely, he mentioned that it could serve as a great complementary tool. He also noted that our tool may actually be more sensitive to tissue localization and movement than traditional radiology procedures. One potential application of our project he could foresee was in aiding clinicians with localization/identification of tumour areas during pre-operative planning, and possibly during surgical/radiology procedures as well. In advancing our project further, he noted that we may want to determine the advantages/disadvantages of delivering the attenuated Salmonella orally or intravenously. He also suggested we look into performing in vivo experimentation with subcutaneously implanted tumours in mice to determine clinical efficacy further.

            <p>As described in our Design page, our AND-gate biosensing system for immune activity in tumours depends on the induction of two promoters, each inducible by a different immune marker. In the search for our optimal two markers to compose the AND-gate, we consulted with various professionals in immunology and pathology to confirm that TNFa and lactate, our proposed markers obtained from literature search, were the most accurate to detect immune activity in an in vivo context.

His research is aimed at understanding cellular signalling mechanisms and protein function in diseases of the immune system, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and autoimmunity.<br><br>
              We interviewed Dr. Lim at the early stages of our project development. We discussed the feasibility of utilizing TNFa and lactate as our primary biomarkers and affirmed that there is a need for a solution to the problem of patient response to tumour immunotherapy. He suggested that we incorporate a 3D tumour microenvironment model into our project design; to accomplish this, we would need to perfuse hydrogel with a specific cancer cell line, stromal cells, and immune cells to replicate the TME. Dr. Lim brought up the issue of controlling the effect of Salmonella in the human body and urged us to look into how Salmonella could potentially change the TME and immune response. He also recommended that we use microfluidics chambers, organoid cultures, and mouse models in the future to benchmark our biosensor tool.

His current research focus includes using genetic engineering to create more potent immune cells for immunotherapy use.<br><br>
            We have competition with other research including imaging proxies for immune activity, so we need to prove that our project has a significant advantage. He thinks our product would work best as a theranostics tool that would both sense immune activity and increase the response to immunotherapy. Since, the US medical system tends towards giving immunotherapy in order to avoid denying someone a possible life-saving treatment. While that process in Canada is more selective, Dr Nelson emphasized that if you are denying treatment to those who do not pass your test, it better be a good test. Dr. Nelson suggested we look for a similar predictive biomarker that could be used across different cancers like anti-PDL1 antibodies are currently used for all MMR cancers. Moreover, Dr. Nelson brought up a couple viable concerns. One is we need to demonstrate if there is any difference in how Salmonella behaves within the same patient depending on differing expression of natural antibodies. Also, Dr. Nelson brought up a potential safety concern regarding Salmonella: even though our Salmonella strain is highly attenuated, what is our plan if the strain mutates? While our team found this unlikely, putting in additional measures to prevent possible harmful mutations would be a great fail safe.

          <p class="lead">She gave insight into our understanding of the Sip A promoter for our construct. She said that using SipA as our promoter might work but SipA might be upregulated so it might not be the best possible regulator. She also said that Salmonella follows the normal growth curve and does well in nutrient deficient environments. Moreover, she suggested an experimental design to test for endotoxins (known to be harmful to the human body) for our attenuated strain: this would remove a potential limitation to our project. She suggested some troubleshooting steps for the colony PCR. She thinks that it would be helpful to visualize Salmonella gene segments using Snapgene. She said that cloning operons can be difficult as they have one promoter so she suggested we clone a big chunk of DNA upstream of sicA. Lastly, she recommended we insert our pieces into a chromosome if plasmid insertions do not work.

        <p class="lead">Dr. Kevin Bennewith suggested some key points to address regarding potential TME modulators and 3D modeling. For potential TME modulators, he said using MMP inhibitors could make things worse and that no individual cytokine will selectively target antitumor immune cells. That said, collagenases - compounds to increase blood perfusion or modulate vasculature to decrease hypoxia and increase immune cell infiltration - are a potential modulation candidate. As for 3D TME modeling, Dr. Bennewith suggested potential modeling aspects including gradients of hypoxia and necrosis surrounding vasculature, fluid exchange, pH, the localization of different immune cell populations within the tumour, and cancer associated fibroblasts. Moreover, he suggested the modulation of macrophage phenotype could be promising to explore since the LPS and immunogenic proteins in Salmonella may already help skew towards M1. If our team was to perform in vivo experimentation, it would take about 2 weeks to grow to a pea-size cancer spheroid with the right cell lines.

      <h2><b>4. Considering Downstream Implementation</b></h2>
      <p>Being part of the diagnostics track, the proposed clinical implementation of our system must be seriously considered, even if we will not carry it out. Using Salmonella as our chassis could evoke hesitation in the target audience, hence speaking to individuals who are more proficient in the medicinal industry and policies would be useful in considering downstream applications.</p>

      <p class="lead">
        We have competition with other research including imaging proxies for immune activity, so we need to prove that our project has a significant advantage. He thinks our product would work best as a theranostics tool that would both sense immune activity and increase the response to immunotherapy. Since, the US medical system tends towards giving immunotherapy in order to avoid denying someone a possible life-saving treatment. While that process in Canada is more selective, Dr Nelson emphasized that if you are denying treatment to those who do not pass your test, it better be a good test. Dr. Nelson suggested we look for a similar predictive biomarker that could be used across different cancers like anti-PDL1 antibodies are currently used for all MMR cancers. Moreover, Dr. Nelson brought up a couple viable concerns. One is we need to demonstrate if there is any difference in how Salmonella behaves within the same patient depending on differing expression of natural antibodies. Also, Dr. Nelson brought up a potential safety concern regarding Salmonella: even though our Salmonella strain is highly attenuated, what is our plan if the strain mutates? While our team found this unlikely, putting in additional measures to prevent possible harmful mutations would be a great fail safe.
