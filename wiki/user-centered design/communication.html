        <p class="intro-text" style="font-size: 2.25em;">Scientific efforts never stand alone. Whether it be through educational outreach or partnerships, scientific communication is an integral part of any work we do as scientists, and consequently work we do in iGEM. It presents the opportunity to spark inspiration for science in others, and get the idea across to stakeholders or like-minded people in the field. In educating the public about our efforts in different scopes - STEM, biology, genetics and our specific project - we sought to widen our audience to reach different age groups, countries, and people who differ in learning ability and socioeconomic status.

          <p>With the rise of biotechnology as an industry, it is more important than ever for scientists to inspire curiosity in STEM in younger audiences. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the relevance of scientific knowledge for all public no matter the age group, encouraging young and elderly alike to be well-informed about topics in molecular biology. As such, the education of synthetic biology should be generalized to the largest range of ages possible. </p>

              <p style="text-align: left;"> The rewritten video series models scientific understanding through different ages, aiming to ameliorate science education and communication of synthetic biology. It was intended to "rewrite" the way that biology is currently presented to cater towards people that science research happens for. People from different professions, ages, and educational backgrounds were interviewed for their thoughts on how biology has had a presence in their lives and if they have ever gotten to learn about the field of synthetic biology. We asked them what a field like this could mean for their lives and future. They brought to light some of the shortcomings in the number of problems that could be addressed by creative genetic engineering solutions. They also acted as springboards for ideation in our project and provided feedback for where we envisioned our project to go down the road. We felt that we had helped educate them on how to extend beyond the confines of what they understand biology to be now and inform them about future developments within this field.

In partnership with Geering up UBC, a STEM club aimed to provide an interactive workshop for highschool and junior high students to learn more about STEM related fields, UBC iGEM created a workshop on genetic engineering. Here, we taught the students the basics of the Central Dogma, CRISPR and DNA manipulation, plasmids, and various cases of ethics in the genetic engineering field. Through these workshops, we hoped to spark enthusiasm in synthetic biology and through this, in the bioengineering field in general for these young students to pursue.

This book aimed at pre-school age children is meant to introduce children to the world of microorganisms that exists all around us. We have held storybook reading sessions at Fun Ville Daycare Center, and we hope to distribute the resource to teachers and parents who can use it to further explain the need for frequent hand washing and social distancing measures that are currently in place.

          <p>A considerable amount of iGEM’s praise comes from its ability to host teams from up to X different countries for the same purpose, uniting knowledge of synthetic biology throughout the world. As such, the UBC iGEM team sees it as a necessity to immerse ourselves in this universality through collaboration with both national and international young scientists. Communications that have involved discussion of both scientific and non-scientific topics has allowed us to understand common struggles and goals between groups of different backgrounds.</p>

We decided to highlight the ways in which salmonella can be used to develop clinical solutions by designing infographics to inform the public of i) the clinical implications of cancer, and ii) the potential of salmonella for possibly mitigating some of these effects. As researchers, we were able to share our project efforts with the general public through platforms like Instagram and Facebook. Through this collaborative experience, we effectively highlighted how our approaches are clinically relevant, as well as answered commonly asked questions about cancers and salmonella.

                        <p style="text-align: left;"> Our collaboration with iGEM team USP-Brazil has allowed us to diversify our outreach efforts throughout multiple continents. The UBC iGEM x USP iGEM collab included working on two educational projects that aimed to communicate and expose Brazilian children and teenagers to the beauty of science and synthetic biology, having weekly meetings from April until September. One of the projects worked on was called “Scientific Camp”, in which children in elementary school were exposed to a personalized fantastic narrative that changed depending on their preferences, and included scientific challenges throughout the story to go to the next level of the story, engaging the children in a fun way, while stimulating their investigative reasoning skills and learning science. The collaboration included the elaboration of the entire camp, including the planning of each challenge, refinement of the story and ____.

                        <br><br> The other project worked on during the collaboration was “Synthetic Biology Olympiad”, in which teenagers currently enrolled in high school could participate in an exam that had an objective to encourage interest in the field of synthetic biology and employ critical thinking skills in science. The online format of this olympiad would allow for quick and equal access to the activities through a standard phone plan, and the questions of the olympiad were coordinated between our two teams. This allowed for us to contribute to the dissemination of STEM knowledge in people with differing socioeconomic conditions, where information of this kind is harder to get by.

            <p style="text-align:left;"">Despite our efforts to reach all age groups and nationalities with scientific educational material, we recognize that all individuals learn differently. Hence, we must account for these differences that would otherwise hinder the audience’s ability to receive information.</p>

              <h2>CODE Initiative</h2>
              <p > We believe that learning relevant concepts in science can happen at any age, as young as pre-school if given age-appropriate resources. “The Adventures of Kleb” is a storybook written and illustrated by various members of our team in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This book aimed at pre-school age children is meant to introduce children to the world of microorganisms that exists all around us. We have held storybook reading sessions at Fun Ville Daycare Center, and we hope to distribute the resource to teachers and parents who can use it to further explain the need for frequent hand washing and social distancing measures that are currently in place.

          <br>
          <p>Even if we tailor our outreach materials to the widest possible range of audiences, every person has a personal preference of how they prefer to receive educational content. Through having a large range of mediums to hand out our material, it becomes more accessible to the audiences we want to reach. For this reason, we made sure our work spanned written content, video or visual content, and interpersonal content such as workshops or project-based meeting discussions. Each initiative is consequently labelled as one of the three:
